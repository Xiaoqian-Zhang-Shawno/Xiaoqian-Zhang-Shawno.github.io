excerpt: "We propose Mamba2MIL, a novel state space duality-based MIL framework for computational pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WSI datasets."

Computational pathology (CPath) has significantly advanced the clinical practice of pathology. Despite the progress made, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a promising paradigm within CPath, continues to face challenges, particularly related to incomplete information utilization.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel MIL framework called **Mamba2MIL**. Our framework utilizes the state space duality model (SSD) to model long sequences of patches from whole slide images (WSIs), combined with weighted feature selection. This supports flexible fusion of branching features and adaptation to different needs. We also introduce a **sequence transformation method** tailored to varying WSI sizes, improving sequence representation while preserving local features.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mamba2MIL outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods across multiple datasets. On the NSCLC dataset, it achieves a binary tumor classification **AUC of 0.9533** and high overall accuracy.
