Hi, I'm **Xiaoqian Zhang/Shawno Zhang (张啸谦)**, a master's student in *Medical Imaging Technology* at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University（SJTU）**.  
I hold a bachelor's degree in **Biomedical Engineering** from **Beihang University (BUAA)**.

My research interest lies in the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **healthcare**, with a current focus on:

- 🧠 **Multimodal foundation models** for medical tasks (e.g., MedGPT, MedCLIP)
- 🩻 **Medical image analysis**, especially in radiology and ultrasound
- 🤖 **Large model fine-tuning & deployment (LLM Engineering)**
- 🏥 AI-empowered clinical decision systems and cognitive diagnostics

I aim to bridge the gap between **medical imaging data**, **neural networks**, and **clinical utility**, ultimately contributing to trustworthy and efficient medical AI systems.

### 🧠 Philosophy

> "AI can’t replace doctors, but doctors who use AI will replace those who don’t."

I believe building trustworthy, interpretable, and accessible AI tools will shape the next era of healthcare.  
Let’s work together toward that future.
